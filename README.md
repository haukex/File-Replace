File-Replace-Inplace
====================

This is the distribution of the Perl module
[`File::Replace::Inplace`](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Replace::Inplace).

It is a Perl extension that provides a replacement for Perl's inplace editing
of files (`-i`) using `File::Replace`.

Please see the module's documentation (POD) for details (try the command
`perldoc lib/File/Replace/Inplace.pm`) and the file `Changes` for version
information.

Important Note About the Repository
-----------------------------------

Because this module's code was forked from the original File-Replace
distribution and repository, its code is still contained in the
`File-Replace` repository, **branch `reinplace`**, which you can find
at **<https://github.com/haukex/File-Replace/tree/reinplace>**.

If you're checking out this suite of modules from Git, I suggest the following:

	git clone --branch tiehandle https://github.com/haukex/File-Replace.git Tie-Handle-Base
	git clone --branch onlyreplace https://github.com/haukex/File-Replace.git File-Replace
	git clone --branch fancyreplace https://github.com/haukex/File-Replace.git File-Replace-Fancy
	git clone --branch reinplace https://github.com/haukex/File-Replace.git File-Replace-Inplace

Installation
------------

To install this module type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

If you are running Windows, you may need to use `dmake`, `nmake`, or `gmake`
instead of `make`.

Dependencies
------------

Requirements: Perl v5.8.1 or higher (a more current version is *strongly*
recommended) and several of its core modules; users of older Perls may need
to upgrade some core modules.

Since this is an extension to `File::Replace`, that module is required.

The full list of required modules can be found in the file `Makefile.PL`.
This module should work on any platform supported by these modules.
